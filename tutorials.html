      Introduction to Terasology
    </h2>
    <p>Terasology is both a game and a game engine, written in Java. Because of this, while it is possible to create
      simple assets, like new blocks, without knowledge of Java, for anything more complicated at least a bit of
      knowledge about it is required. Don't worry though, if you don't know Java, as there exists a great deal of good
      Java tutorials out there on the internet, and Terasology codebase was made with simplicity for module developers
      &mdash;that is, <b>YOU</b> &mdash; in mind. So, go google for one of those tutorials and then come back here!</p>
    <p>
      Back already? Then continue to our tutorials following, which will guide you through setting up the developer
      workspace.

      Done that already? Then pop on our server at <a href="https://discord.gg/Terasology/">https://discord.gg/Terasology/</a>
      (or, if you prefer IRC, the same chat is bridged both ways to #terasology on freenode, so feel free to pop in
      there).

    <p>
      From this point onwards, you can start trying to figure things out on your own, or continue following our handy
      tutorials. If you opt for the first option, though, be wary of several things:
    </p>
    <ul class="browser-default">
      <li><i>y</i> axis is the vertical one</li>
      <li>
        The whole architecture is based off
        <a href="https://metaterasology.github.io/docs/concepts/entitySystem.html">ECS</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Stuff is loaded solely through our asset-handling library <i>gestalt</i>, and any attempt to access filesystem
        directly will result in sandbox violation and crash
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Creating simple assets
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you want to create only simple assets, that is blocks/shapes/whatever, that don't have any functionality and
      just <i>are</i>, you don't need to have much coding experience. In fact, you don't need to have any.
